# Restaurant Recommender System (Chatbot)

This project focuses on developing a restaurant recommendation systems that interacts with users in dialogue (i.e. simple chatbot). 
The underlying mechanism for this system is a state-transition model that manages the dialog flow by transitioning between predefined states based on the predicted user’s dialog acts.
The system classifies sentences given by the user to predict what the user wants using multiple ((non-)machine learning) models. 
Through the extraction of the user’s preferences and recommends a restaurant in the end, providing additional information such as phone number and address. 
Extra configurability options are available, such enabling text-to-speech or having a delay before giving a response.
