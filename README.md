# Restaurant Recommender System (Chatbot)

This project focuses on a restaurant recommendation system that interacts with users in a dialog manner. It classifies sentences given by 
the user to predict what the user wants using multiple ((non-)machine learning) models. It extracts the user’s preferences and recommends 
a restaurant at the end, providing additional information such as phone number and address. It also has extra configurability options, like 
enabling text-to-speech or having a delay before giving a response. The underlying mechanism for this system is a state-transition model 
that manages the dialog flow by transitioning between predefined states based on the predicted user’s dialog acts.
